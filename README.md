### Development Path Clarification

After releasing version 2.9.0, which had significant issues, development returned to the stable 2.8.0 codebase. Version 2.10.0 was developed internally but never publicly released. Instead, version 2.10.1 was released as the new stable version, incorporating lessons learned from the problematic 2.9.0 release.
